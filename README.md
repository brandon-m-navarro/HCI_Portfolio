## About Me

Hello! My name is Brandon Navarro and I'm currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute majoring in Computer Science. As you can see above, this website was created as a way to showcase the projects that I have worked on in the previous seven weeks.

Below you can find the links to the Medium articles that I wrote detailing the design process that was follwed for each respective project.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brandon-m-navarro/HCI_Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
