## About Me

Hello! My name is Brandon Navarro and I'm currently a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute majoring in Computer Science. As you can see above, this website was created as a way to showcase the projects that I have worked on in the previous seven weeks.

Below you can find the links to the Medium articles that I wrote detailing the design process that was followed for each respective project as well as a link to the article I wrote summarizing what I learned throughout the term.

[Design For Others](https://medium.com/@benemrick/group-1-design-for-others-998326e8287d) - 
  The goal of this project was to redesign an existing website for mobile phones with a specific user group in mind. Our team developed paper prototypes to test our design and created a final interactive prototype using _InVision_. 

[Design For Understanding](https://medium.com/@brandon.m.navarro/design-for-understanding-3ce5180c100e) - 
  The goal of this project was to create a visual representation for a chosen dataset. Our team developed our visuals using _Vega_. Using _Vega_, one can concisely describe a visualization as a set of encodings that map from data fields to the properties of graphical marks, using a JSON format.
  
[Design For Tension](https://medium.com/@brandon.m.navarro/design-for-tension-f5271f7203bf) - 
  The goal of this project was to create a chatbot that informed users about a divisive topic. Our team chose to discuss the topic of gerrymandering and created a chatbot using _Flow XO_ that provides the user with a dialogue that informs them about the issues gerrymandering raises along with proposed solutions.
  
[Design For Wellbeing](https://medium.com/@brandon.m.navarro/design-for-wellbeing-179f9d2e348c) - 
  The goal for this project was to use the _Affectiva_ libraries to create a website that responded to user emotion. Our team created a webpage that links to different applications of the _Affectiva_ library, with myself working on the "Crazy Confetti" portion of the site.

[Design For Another World](https://medium.com/@zachberry_90708/design-for-another-world-a632987b95f3) -
  The goal for this project was to use the _AFrame_ framework to create a virtual reality experience. Our team decided to create a rhythm game where the player must block incoming projectiles with two shields. This was done by importing a number of libraries for the physics, collision, environment, and music synchronization. Additionally, the link for the _Glitch_ repository can be found [here](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/magma-music).
